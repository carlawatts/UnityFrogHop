# UnityFrogHop

 -Iterations-
 Originally the player characters were just jumping over eachother, so I added a small course for them to jump across.
 Platforms where smaller, but I made them larger so it's easier to stay on.
 A pit was added so players can fall, but get back up from the start
 Changed textures to stone and water to look like a pond.
 Frog models were added to make it feel like leap frog
 --
 Added GUI
 --
 Collectable flies were added
 Inventory was added
 Logs with gravity were added
 --
 Remade score scripts to work with the new mechanic
 Color coded orbs/flies were added, if a player touches the orb/fly of the other player's color they get a point. If you hit all 3 of the other player's orbs/flies, they win.
 Added a final goal, giant blue frog, that will display the winning message and restart the game to play again. 
 
 -Game design tools-
 *Goals: See which player can get to the blue frog the fastest while avoiding the other player's colored orbs/flies. Or try to mess up the other player by pushing them into your colored orbs/flies.
 
 *Challenge: Don't fall off the platforms or you have to start over and make your way back to where you were. No air control, once you jump you are committed so you have to make sure you like up your jumps before hand. Don't run into the other player's colored orb/fly, this will give them a point, if you do this 3 times they automatically win. Logs can also mess up your jumps, so watch out.

 *Skill: Practice jumping controls to not fall off the platforms, avoid logs, and the other player's orbs/flies.
