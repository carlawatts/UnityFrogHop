# UnityFrogHop

 # -Iterations-
 Originally the player characters were just jumping over eachother, so I added a small course for them to jump across.
 Platforms where smaller, but I made them larger so it's easier to stay on.
 A pit was added so players can fall, but get back up from the start
 Changed textures to stone and water to look like a pond.
 Frog models were added to make it feel like leap frog
 
 # -Game design tools-
 *Goals: See which player can get the most points.
 
 *Challenge: Don't fall off the platforms or you have to start over and make your way back to where you were. No air control, once you jump you are committed so you have to make sure you like up your jumps before hand.

 *Skill: Practice jumping controls to not fall off the platforms.
